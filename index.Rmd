# Learning HTML

## What is the index.html file?

The index.html file is the backbone of your webpage, it is the home screen and the center where all things seem to render from. It's also not that complicated, it's quite similar to any other .html file you will find on your soon to be webpage, but the name acts like a default setting and points to where your browser should look in the folder when rendering your page. 

## What do I know?

I know how to analyze environmental data, and how to write some software in a few different langues, but I have never done web development before, or written an RBookdown file. 

### My goal {-}

is to use this section of the website to take notes, and to practice writing in a new style. And by the end of it, hopefully I will have a few new skills, 



```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
